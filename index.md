Hello!

I am currently a software developer for [The Jonah Group](https://www.jonahgroup.com/) and an [assistant coach for the Men's Volleyball Program at UofT](http://www.varsityblues.ca/roster.aspx?path=mvball).

My days are spent [tapping on a keyboard](https://github.com/robertsonmcclure) or [coaching volleyball](http://varsityblues.ca/index.aspx?path=mvball&), sometimes at the same time!

Every now and then [I write about what's on my mind]({{ "/blog" | absolute_url }}). Also currently pursuing a Math Major and Computer Science Specialist at UofT.

If you're interested, [here's my resume.]({% link resume.pdf %})
