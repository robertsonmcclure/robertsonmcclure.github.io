She was standing at the front of the line as I got on the bus. This tall blonde beauty made me do a double take. As she boards the bus I shift over to open a seat beside me. It’s just my luck that she sits directly in front of me. I end up with a slightly overweight, middle aged man as my seat companion. I accept the defeat and open my laptop, I had recently downloaded three movies and I wanted to finish at least one of them.

The bus ride from Huntsville to Toronto on July 28th 2015 took about 4 hours. A half finished cryptic crossword and Jurassic World amused me for just over two hours. As we near Toronto, people trickle off the bus at each stop. I’m trying to connect to the inconsistent bus wifi network and I notice that the seat next to me has vacated, along with the seat next to the girl in the row in from of me. I notice that she’s idly browsing Instagram on her phone and I know that if I don’t say something, I know that I’ll regret it more than any potential embarrassment.

I float an “Excuse me…” forward between the seats and she turns, surprised. Until this point in time, I never have a clear view of her face. I could tell she was beautiful, but I never realized how gorgeous she was until she turned around in her seat. I have no idea how I vocalized the words asking her about connecting to the wifi, but within seconds she’s animated, telling me how much of a pain in the ass it was for her to connect.

The conversation shifts away wifi and I find myself enthralled. There are two types of people in the world, those who are easy to talk to and those who aren’t. The latter stand out like a sore thumb because conversation grinds to a halt every few sentences. On the other hand, the former are so easy to talk to that hours go by without either party realizing it. I glanced out the window mid sentence and to my surprise we were on the outskirts of Toronto. We had been talking for 20 minutes and I didn’t even know her name.

I still don’t know how to spell her name, but for the sake of this blog post I’ll go with “Hailey”. Before I knew it, the bus rolled into the station at Bay and Dundas. I took my sweet time getting my backpack unjammed from the overhead compartment and when I looked up she was gone. The last I saw of Hailey was her strolling across the street, cell phone casually to her ear. As I watched her go I realized I probably would never see her again.

I don’t know how to spell her first name, let alone what her last name was. We didn’t exchange any social media handles, or phone numbers. We had a single mutual connection from Hamilton, but after I looked into it I realized it was more of a “her older sister was in the same grade as the older sister of a friend of mine” sort of deal. In a world of hyper connectivity it’s weird to come to the sobering reality that I have no way to contact her.

Normally this would be fine, but I can’t get Hailey off my mind. Her smile and laugh have stayed with me. The conversation flowed like a babbling brook. She was tall, elegant and articulate. Why didn’t I get her number? Why didn’t I ask her out? I wish I knew. I wish I had.

She will forever be The Girl on the Bus, perfect in every way, except for the fact that I can’t see her again. This has never happened to me before, I don’t usually start conversations with total strangers. I don’t usually flirt with people I don’t know, but I guess there’s a first time for everything. I wasn’t trying to flirt, but I knew that if I didn’t say something I would regret it.

We are presented with so many opportunities to reach out and touch another persons life, but so rarely do we seize them. I can’t remember the last time I asked a stranger for directions. I can’t remember the last time I complimented someone I didn’t know or received a nice word from a stranger. These type of interactions don’t happen anymore as everyone is buried in their own tech. We feel so connected to our thousands of Facebook Friends, but these are ethereal connections without any substance. Nobody fondly reminisces over that text message conversation, or tells stories about discovering a snap that made their day. The connections we cherish are physical, the people who are actually spending time with you.

This thoughts are quasi inspired by Mike Pearse, who recently opened a dialog with the staff at Camp Tawingo about my generation’s dependance on the Internet. Too often one can find four friends sitting around a table, all on their smart phones, telling people that aren’t there, about how much fun their having with people, they aren’t actually talking to. This scene has been played out thousands of times over in every major city in the world. Mike’s lament struck a chord with me and has stuck in the back of my head, much like The Girl on the Bus.

If I had never floated a soft “Excuse me…” forward on an Ontario Northland bus, I would’ve never made a connection with Hailey. I could’ve clicked on the next movie and amused myself by watching Pitch Perfect 2 or Ex Machina. Hailey seemed perfectly content with browsing Instagram, flicking from account to account, reading comment after comment. I guess Mike’s Lament was floating in my subconscious, and made me shut down my laptop and made a real connection. I guess it’s fitting that a connection that began in spite of technology, ended in the same manner. Even with the plethora of networks that are built on Friending and Following other people, I have no way of contact Hailey.

It feels bitter-sweet because I know, I just know, that there could have been more between us. However I refuse to find The Girl on the Bus through social media. I refuse to contact her with an animated bubble on a screen. If we happen to cross paths again, I will be euphoric, I will be ecstatic and I will be completely over the moon.
