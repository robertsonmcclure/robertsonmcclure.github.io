Today began at 12:00am, just like every other day. Unlike every other day, I was not asleep in my bed at midnight. I was saying my goodbyes at Sam Clarke’s birthday party where I had been for the past 4 hours. Eventually I made it home, after 30 minutes of widely careening bicycle headlights and Twist and Shout by the Beatle’s.

The morning came jarringly early as my alarm awoke me at exactly 5:30. Later in the day I found myself in a George Brown lecture hall listening to a volunteering from the Pan Am games give us the rundown of exactly what a Results Associate would do. I don’t normally nod off in class, but when I do, I drool on my shirt. I also had to foresight to sit next to the cutest girl in the room, which made my awakening all the more enjoyable for me.

Alertness is weird. Places and situations can create a sense of tiredness but the minute you remove yourself from said place you feel alive. It’s a peculiar feeling which has happened across me too many times today. I feel my evening will not consist of a second party in a row but a good long night in my bed. There’s something to be said for sleeping in on Sundays… which is exactly what I plan to do tomorrow.

My personal challenge has been going well, I think. Audiobooks are a welcome distraction while biking and I haven’t had to turn down too many personal arrangements to fit my new sleep cycle. Piano is fun but I need a new song to work on. I need to find a pop song that will be challenging enough to keep me busy, complex enough to be impressive, but learnable without a teacher. I know that technically every song is learnable without a teacher but I’m not sure I’m mentally tough enough to impose strict guidelines on myself while playing piano. I’ve always needed an outside force to critique my playing as I quickly lapse into a “it’s totally good enough mindset”. I think I enjoy listening to music too much to be critical of it. The previous sentence is very hit and miss now that I think about it. I am either not critical at all or overly so. There are times that I’m so overly critical of my own playing that I can’t stand to listen to myself because it’s not as good as the song that I want to hear, but just can’t make my fingers create.

Practicing piano has no impact on my career or productivity. But I believe it does wonders for my mental health. On that note, pun intended, I will resume practicing.

Time is the only finite resource we posses, thank you for yours.
