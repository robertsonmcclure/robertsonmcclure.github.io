I first heard about AMP from a good friend of mine, [Alexei Darmin](http://alexeidarmin.ca). He encouraged me to transform my own personal website, as he had. This is my journey.

### 11:00am Monday October 31st

My site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) so I begin my search by Googling "amp jekyll". I discover [this repository](https://github.com/juusaw/amp-jekyll) which looks promising, but I'm not totally sure I want to leave everything to a plugin. I want to know exactly what is going on.

When I want to know what's going on, I usually start with [tutorials](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/create) and then dig down into the [source code](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml).

I love good documentation and I'm happy with what I've found on the [AMP Website](https://www.ampproject.org/). After a quick skim of the tutorial, I've decided to create a new page called [home]({{ site.url }}/home) to test of what I'm learning. The easiest way to learn something is to have a project that forces you to learn skills for it's completion. It drives you and focuses your attention to the really important things.

I have just discovered `style="responsive"` and I love it. Such necessary parts of mobile web development should always be this verbose. The fact that you can add `#development=1` to the page's URL to debug is also a really nice feature. I'm pretty impressed with this right now and am very excited to continue incorporating this into my blog.
