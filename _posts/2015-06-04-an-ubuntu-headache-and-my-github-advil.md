My odyssey started last night when I decided I should look into Linux as an Operating System. Once down the rabbit hole it is very hard to return. The roadblocks I encountered were peculiar to say the least.

This entire event occurred when I came across the idea that programming in a Linux environment was intrinsically better than in one curated by Apple. After some initial research and many a persuasive site, I decided that I would install Ubuntu on my Macbook Air. I had to teach myself how to partition my laptop and create a bootable USB so that I could dual boot Mac OS and Ubuntu. This did not go as planned.

In order to install Ubuntu fully, one has to be connected to the internet. I was not when Ubuntu first started up. I thought it would be a simple task to fix. After much hair pulling later I realized that since I could not get the wifi to work without installing an update, and the fact that a Macbook Air does not have an ethernet port, I could not connect to the internet while on Ubuntu.

Throughout this adventure I had to rummage through my house looking for USBs and connecting cables that I knew existed but couldn’t find. After all my trouble I gave up for the evening and went to bed. As I lay there my mind continued to process the events of the day. Suddenly I remembered that my family owned a 2011 Macbook Pro that was currently not being used. I knew that the Macbook Pro had an ethernet port as it used to be mine. I decided to stay in bed as I was already mentally and physically exhausted from a long day.

With the chirping of birds, Sunday May 24th began. I rolled out of bed late, for my usual 5:30am standards, and began to ruminate on the coming task: installing Ubuntu. After a light breakfast of cereal, the next chapter in my odyssey began. The process of setting up the Macbook Pro consisted in tearing the house apart trying to find it’s charging cable, the ethernet cable, a big enough USB and, of course, locating the computer itself.

The installation finished just as my mother returned home and I had to pleasure of showing her the new computer. After playing around on Ubuntu I realized that though it may be super useful and very practical to me, I was aesthetically and very much tied to my existing MacOS set up. Things like trackpad reactiveness, scrolling effects and iTunes have become so integrated in how I use my computer, that this new environment felt foreign and very wrong in certain aspects. It was here I had my realization that I really didn’t need to use this Operating System.

Having come to this refreshing realization I escaped to the out-of-doors to enjoy yet another beautiful day. After soaking in the rays on my bike ride I set myself up in a Starbucks learn the ins and outs of Github. I discovered Github a few weeks ago and used it to develop a webpage, but I didn’t really understand why everything worked as it did. What were “commits” and why couldn’t I figure out the desktop application. Two hours later I felt enlightened and extremely happy as my research into Github led me to TextMate and a deeper understanding of Terminal, the command line.

Reflecting, I didn’t fully waste the last 24 hours with my exploration of Ubuntu, because my old Macbook Pro has had new life breathed into it. It lead me to refocus on Github and I am happy with the resulting effect.

I’m feeling pretty jumpy as I have switched from task to task over the last week. From learning HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Objective-C, Swift, jQuery, Ubuntu and the inner workings of Github. I feel like an extremely hungry dog in the middle of a room filled with treats, so many things to do, so many options to choose from. The fear is that I’ll be too shallow with each of my explorations and only skim the surface of the possible pool of knowledge. Conversely I don’t want to get too in-depth as I may never get the chance to use that knowledge. I hope that I am maintaining a healthy balance of focus and diversity. However I am sure of one thing: I’m learning more things per day than I ever have before.

Time is the only finite resource we posses, thank you for yours.
