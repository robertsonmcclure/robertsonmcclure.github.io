> Stop what you're doing and go read The Circle.

This should be doubly emphasized for anyone in the technology sector or working with social media.

The reason I find [The Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Circle_(Eggers_novel)) so chilling is that it all makes total sense. There is a logical progression from where we are today to where the book ends up. The worst part is that at no point on this journey from here to there was there an "evil" event. There is no discernible event that we could have easily foreseen as leading to this eventual state. The worst part is every involved fully believed in what they were doing and that is was for the good of humanity. The worst part is it's very hard to make an argument against their logic. The worst part is society asked for it all. We willingly shackle ourselves to a company and give away basic freedoms like privacy for a new gadget.

[Uber](https://www.uber.com/en-CA/) was in the news recently.

Uber [bought data about a competitor](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/technology/personal-data-firm-slice-unroll-me-backlash-uber.html) from a company called [Slice Intelligence](https://intelligence.slice.com/). The chilling part came when consumers actually came to realized what Slice's business model was. The product in question was a service called [Unroll.Me](https://unroll.me/) that advertises that it will clean up your inbox. This is "a free service", as their website puts it. Services are [never free](https://www.recode.net/2017/4/28/15454018/unroll-me-controversy-data-uber-ad-based-business-models-free-service). Unroll.Me took all the emails, read all the receipts in your inbox and stored everything in a database. Slice, the owner of Unroll.Me, was then able to sell this data to any companies willing to pay for it. Uber used it to track the use of it's competitor Lyft.

If you click on one link, [choose this one](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/travis-kalanick-pushes-uber-and-himself-to-the-precipice.html). It's an example of fantastic journalism concerning Uber, thank you [Mike Isaac](https://www.nytimes.com/by/mike-isaac).

Tangentially, Uber was also recently involved in another [privacy scandal](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/travis-kalanick-pushes-uber-and-himself-to-the-precipice.html). Uber engineers created a feature that allowed them to fingerprint phones so they could track customers after the app was deleted and permanently fingerprint devices. This broke Apple's terms for using their App Store. The part of the story that seems like it was lifted straight from a dystopian novel was the fact that the Uber Engineers who created these features were aware that they were breaking the rules. They were so aware they attempted to [cover it up](http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ceo-tim-cook-threatened-travis-kalanick-over-ubers-app-in-2015-2017-4) with a technique called [geofencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence). It was configured such that any Apple Engineers in certain geographic locations (their offices) could not see the offensive code. This came to light when off-campus Apple Engineers noticed the discrepancy.

Accidentally creating a technological monolith that consumes the world is one thing, willingly doing it is another thing. A completely different thing.

> If you are not paying, you are the product.

This is how the internet works now. You pay with your privacy. Facebook is free because it makes money off you. You are the product and advertisers are the customers.

When and why did this happen? I don't know. At some point in the past we hit a pivotal moment where we had to choose between a price tag and privacy (or lack there of). We chose to sell our privacy and this is where we are today.

Will we end up with the Circle? I don't know. I hope not. I really do.

The Circle is absolutely _chilling_ and _prophetic_. If you don't trust me, those are two quotes from _The Washington Post_ and _The New York Times_ respectively. I implore you to read this book at your earliest convenience.

These are my initial, knee jerk reaction, thoughts to finishing The Circle just hours ago. Oh, and I'm acutely aware of the irony that comes with sharing these thoughts on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/robertsonmcclure) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/robertsonmcclur). I make zero money from you reading these words, and oh, I'm taking solace in that fact.
