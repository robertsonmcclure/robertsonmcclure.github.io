I was an athlete for two years but now I do statistical analysis for the Varsity Blues Men's Volleyball Team at the University of Toronto. Getting the opportunity to use [Data Project](http://www.dataproject.com/) software, [Data Volley](http://www.dataproject.com/Products/IT/it/Volleyball/DataVolley4) in particular, is absolutely amazing. Additionally, I am constantly humbled by my teammates unconditional work ethic and the unreal community which forms around competitive sport.

I am so fortunate to be trained by [Vincenzo Mallia](http://www.varsityblues.ca/news/2014/9/25/WVB_0925142347.aspx) in using [Data Volley](http://www.dataproject.com/Products/IT/it/Volleyball/DataVolley4).
