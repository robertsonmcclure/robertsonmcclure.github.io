In the summer of 2016, working at [StockRender](https://stockrender.com), I went from zero to hero (full stack developer). I used [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Koa](http://koajs.com/) for the backend and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), [GoldenLayout](https://www.golden-layout.com/), [Material](http://www.material-ui.com/#/) for the frontend. I also took advantage of third party APIs such as [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for user management, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/ca) for payment processing, [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/) for data, and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) for tweets.
