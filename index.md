[I write about what's on my mind]({{ "/blog" | absolute_url }}). I think a lot about software, life, sports and self-improvement.

I study Math and Computer Science at UofT.

Most of my day is spent [tapping on a keyboard](https://github.com/robertsonmcclure) or [coaching volleyball](http://varsityblues.ca/index.aspx?path=mvball&), sometimes at the same time!

If you're interested, [here's my resume.]({% link resume.pdf %})
