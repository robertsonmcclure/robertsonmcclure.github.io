Today I have a dentist's appointment. Since this puts a damper on going in to the
office, I might as well redesign my personal site. I finally downloaded Jekyll
instead of using it through Github Pages. This gave me the classical Jekyll default
theme, which I will now attempt to make my own. My goal is a minimalist site that
is easy to read.
