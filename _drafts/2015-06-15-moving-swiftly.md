Over the past year I have found myself returning to the same idea again and again: owning a .com domain of my own. The need I feel is part controlling my online identity and part narcissism. However I cannot justify spending money on a personal domain when it is not necessary. It may feel necessary to me right now, but I’m sure I can get by just fine with robertsonmcclure.github.io and robertsonmcclure.wordpress.com.

My github address is fully controlled by me, each character in every HTML file created by me. This level of control is really satisfying but leads to many headaches. What font should be used? Is the colour palette too dark? Why doesn’t that box behave like I want it to? So many pedantic issues surface which need to be addressed lest the site appear plain wrong. I do believe that there are packages which allow these issues to be packaged into a shortcut, and I should look into that. However, as contradictory as this may sound, I have no reason to.

One does not simply go forth and code. There needs to be an end goal, a destination to be reached. Of course the adage about the journey being more important than the destination still holds true. The mistakes that occur while attempting to code a decent project are bountiful and the lessons learned from fixing them are invaluable, but these mistakes never crop up if there is no goal in the first place. You don’t learn anything about getting around obstacles if you don’t have a destination to head towards.

My current problem is that is have no goal to head towards. An idea which I’ve been playing around with is becoming a developer for Apple. This is a long and arduous road and I’ve been finding it difficult to stay on track. There are so many different things to learn and I don’t have a product that I want to create. There is no application, for iOS or OS X, that I feel compelled to bring into this world. Perhaps I’ll make an application all about myself, as that’s the only material I have to work with. An app dedicated to Robertson McClure, definitely a shining example of how small my ego is.
