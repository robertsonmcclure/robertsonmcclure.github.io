# Personal Website

This personal website has evolved over the years as I learn more about web development. I recently switched to Jekyll and I love the Jekyll environment.

This website could be called an 'Online Resume', as it does contain my literal resume and a link to LinkedIn. However I use it mainly for the purposes of learning web development, so the site is constantly being tweaked and updated.

### Run for the hills, something is broken!

More likely than not, something will be broken. Sometimes it's me testing a feature, sometimes it's not. If you find anything broken, feel free to drop me a message. You could also laugh at my foolish ways and not tell me, whatever floats your boat.
