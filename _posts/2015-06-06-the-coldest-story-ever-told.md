The Day I Learned to Love the Bus

The date is Saturday June 6th and it is 5am. I begrudgingly roll out of bed and attempt to make myself cereal. No matter how hard I try I cannot get the ratio of cereal to milk right. The fact that I am still asleep did not help my cause. I’m supposed to help my mother install her Urban Intervention in the fifteen minutes. I can barely walk down stairs so I stay home while she tries to change the city one street at a time.

For the past month I had been looking forward to this day, or more importantly this weekend. I had been invited to a cottage to not only spend the weekend frolicking around a lake, but to share in the joy of watching Episode 9 Season 5 of Game of Thrones. I’m more excited to get into a canoe than to watch television, as crazy as that may sound. Ever since I was 11 years old I’ve spent a portion of my summer at Camp Tawingo. This will be the first year in almost a decade that I won’t be spending at least two weeks enjoying the great out-of-doors at Camp Tawingo.

I digress from the Coldest Story Ever Told. I’m currently on a bus to Peterborough. I expected to spend an eventful 2.5 hours on the bus with my two closest friends, cracking jokes and saying stupid things. However I find myself surrounded by sleeping people and next to a budding cartoonist that is painstakingly imitating a comic book. It’s not the worst situation I have found myself in, but far from what I expected. What went wrong?

This entire event went south the second I got onto the bus. Being my mother’s son, I got downtown with half an hour to spare and eventually made my way to the terminal with 10 minutes to spare. Even though I didn’t see Jacob or Bennett, I wasn’t worried. Ever since I could remember I’ve been early to events. This is a habit that rubbed off onto me from my parents, one that I’m especially thankful for. I’m not even worried at this point. I calmly ask the lady running the Greyhound booth where the bus to Peterborough departs from. Her directions were friendly and calming. I made my way to the bus and was greeted with a smile from the guy checking tickets. Sensing no impending doom, I boarded the bus and chose a seat in an empty block of four as an attempt to preserve adjacent seats so the three of us could sit together. I could not imagine how far from the truth I was. With the ever looming deadline approaching I called Jacob, and was greeting with a phrase that literally had me speachless: “I slept through my alarm….”

What makes this reveal all the more shocking is that the cottage in question is Jacob’s family’s cottage. On top of that, his parents are going to meet us at the terminal to drive us to the cottage. I’m stunned. I call Bennett. Up until this point this tale was not the coldest story ever told. I simply begin the phone call by asking Bennett where he is. He’s apologetic and says that he just got out of the subway. I’m nodding my head, everything seems to be going decently well. He then asks a seemingly innocent question: “Is Jacob there?”. Before I can respond he follows up with the biggest icicle that I’ve ever heard: “he has my ticket”.

I freeze. “Well…”, I begin, “Jacob slept through his alarm”. There is a moment of silence on the other end of the line as Bennett processed what I’ve said. A string of profanities follow from both ends of our conversation and it eventually concludes with both of us admitting we have no idea what’s going to happen. Fast foward to now, I’m on the bus to Peterborough alone. It’s as good as time as any to write a blog post.

Time is the only finite resource we possess. Thank you for yours
