I created a novel website for Janet, one that felt like a book.
It's responsive and very mobile friendly.
I decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), because the site isn't very complex right now to need a CMS.
However, I am considering looking into other alternatives as the site continues to grow.
