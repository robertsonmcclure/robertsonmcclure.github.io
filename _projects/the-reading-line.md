I inherited thereadingline.ca as a WordPress site, and [the old site is still live here](http://www.thereadingline.ca).
It's unwieldy and has all these little bugs that I don't have the time nor patience to get rid of.
That is why I've created a  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site to take its place.
