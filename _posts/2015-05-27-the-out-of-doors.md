Being outside makes me very happy. That is one of the reasons why I have chosen to spend my summers at Camp Tawingo. There is a phrase used by the Camp Director, Mike Pearse, that has stuck with me throughout the years. It goes something like “We have fun building great kids in the out-of-doors”. That last bit always makes me stop and think. “Out-of-doors” sounds so similar to the very common “outdoors” but adding that third syllable changes it. It makes it an entirely different creature.

As I was watching the documentary Helvetica today, that phrase just popped into my head. “Out-of-doors” had nothing to do with what was on screen, yet it persisted to attract my attention. This was probably because I was sitting in Starbucks facing a massive wall of windows. The ceiling was twice as high as it needed to be, and these windows took up an entire wall, floor to ceiling. It was gorgeous, it was lovely, there aren’t enough adjectives at my disposal to describe how much I enjoyed the view. Then I realized something very telling about my study habits.

I have always always always studied facing a window. When I was growing up my house had a designed room we called the office for members of my family to work in. There was a desk, filing cabinets and comfortable chairs. The desk was set up against the one window in the room, so that if the person working would glance up they would see the wall of the house next door. It wasn’t the best view, but it still was a view. Since then I have always sought out studying places next to windows, I need the natural light. I never noticed this fact at the time, and never pursued a study spot because of it’s proximity to a window, however when I look back every single study spot that I frequented more than once and situated next to a window. I believe this is why I enjoy working/studying at Starbucks so much. Yes I do love coffee and I usually enjoy Starbuck’s music choice but until today I never really noticed that most Starbucks have floor to ceiling windows. The ones that don’t I don’t return to.

This window-philic behavour was never a conscious decision, but has unconsciously driven me to be in areas with natural light. I would study outside if I could, but I can’t. I can’t study outside because working in direct sunlight is not reasonable to me. In addition wind always has the habit of picking up important documents the second your focus leaves them. Thus my ideal study space, or living space for that matter, is one with a lot of natural light. As I write this I am sitting at my dining room table, facing three large windows that give me a view of the front yard and subsequent cul-de-sac.

Being addicted to windows isn’t the worst addiction out there. I can think of many worse off the top of my head. It also explains my lack of productivity in windowless spaces and subsequent less-than-pleased mood. The more you know yourself, the better suited you are to dealing with yourself. This may seem trivial, but I feel I know myself a little bit better now.

Time is the only finite resource we possess, thank you for yours
