In 2019 I set myself a goal to read one book a week, this year I have no such goal. 

What happened was I took a trip to Europe for 6 weeks and I started slipping behind. Then I started a new job working for Amazon as Software Engineer and completely stopped reading. 

This year I am not setting myself a goal with a specific number of books. Instead, I will simply try to read as much as possible and see what happens on New Years Eve 2020.
