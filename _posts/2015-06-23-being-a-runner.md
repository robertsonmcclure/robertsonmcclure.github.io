I’ve been described as an athletic person. I play volleyball on a University team and am very passionate about it. Being 193 cm is also something which many associate with innate athletic talents. Throughout all my years of sport, from soccer to badminton to volleyball and everything else in between, I have never been a runner.

During the years I competed at soccer, I was a lanky kid and only had one position that I was half decent at; defence. Dribbling the ball was hard and I couldn’t run up and down the field for 90 minutes as a midfielder. Although soccer is one of the most active running sports, I managed to avoid most movement by being very good at moving a short distance very fast and infrequently.

Of course this style of play is what eventually influenced volleyball, which is a sport consisting of nothing but short, high intensity movements. Thus I’ve managed to go pretty much my entire life avoiding running distances.

Being an athlete with chronic injuries, being injury free is a blessing. Having full control over all your body parts and not being impaired is an event to relish. After months of on and off again pain, this past weekend was gorgeous in the sense that I was physically fit and the weather was perfect. Why shouldn’t I go for a 5km run?

There are many excuses which I could think up, but no good reason not to. So I set off at a pace and ran 5km in 27 minutes. I have no idea if that’s a good time for a first run or a time so awful I should never publish that statistic. I did it though, I ran. It was almost as bad as I thought it would be, the constant pain somewhere, the endless excuses bubbling up as to why I could cut my run short. However I finished, I ran 5km. Immediately after the run my body didn’t feel awful but my legs were decently sore.

Spurred on by the endorphin rush from finishing a run I decided that since I was now kilometres away from home, I might as well run another 5km back home. In a sense the second run was easier than the first. The mental game which plagued me at the beginning of my run was virtually non-existent, which compensated for my increased fatigue and slower time.

I didn’t realize it before, having never actually ran, but running is a great time to think. Although I was listening to some pretty intense music, my mind was able to wander and keep pace simultaneously. Interestingly I ended up coming back to the same idea: why do I run?

This is a topic that has been addressed by The Oatmeal and I have to admit that I drew some inspiration from their ideas. When I’m on the topic of crediting individuals who inspire me, Casey Neistat and everything he does is an inspiration for most of the habit changing things that I am doing right now. The Oatmeal addressed the question Why Do I Run, as the creator has run many marathons and many other forms of extended torture for the lower half of one’s body. The arguments are interesting and funny and I mulled over most of them during the 10km that I happened to run in one day. However I kept on returned to the reason that I actually run.

Because I can.

There have been days when it feels like I am an 80 year old man waiting to die, thats the feeling I get from pain that prevents me from walking. Being able to run is as freeing as the rush of endorphins that comes immediately afterwards a good work out.

I run because I am able to run.
