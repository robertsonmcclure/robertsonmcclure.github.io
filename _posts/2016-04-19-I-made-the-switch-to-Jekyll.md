I have hosted a blog on Wordpress for the last 12 months. I have thoroughly enjoyed using their services, however something always felt amiss. I did not have the amount of control over the design that I desired. I really enjoy beautiful things, and I couldn't find a Wordpress theme that could properly frame my written content. This is why I've always found Github Pages extremely inticing because of the ability to tweak the smallest of details. However, I thought that hosting a blog on a Github Page would be an exhorbinant amount of work. Once I stumbled upon <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, I realized all problems were solved. All I needed to do was learn how to use Jekyll. Thanks to the writings of <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">Jonathan McGlone</a> I quickly created a working blog repository, and finally had the amount of control over the aesthetics and functionally of the site that I craved.
