My dad's name is Robert, which makes me Robert's son. My first name is a dad joke.

[I write about what's on my mind]({{ "/blog" | absolute_url }}). It could be about sports, software, life, or a personal experience.

In 2014 I started UofT studying Pure Math. On a whim I took a Computer Science course and never looked back.

Most of my time is spent [tapping on a keyboard](https://github.com/robertsonmcclure) or [coaching volleyball](http://varsityblues.ca/index.aspx?path=mvball&), sometimes at the same time!
