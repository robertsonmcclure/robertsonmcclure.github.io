I love reading books. This is a list of my favourite books that I've read over the past 22 years.

I want to make this yearly tradition, where I look back and list the books I've enjoyed the most. Since I have to start somewhere, this list will include my all time favourites, instead of just the one's I finished this year.

The list is divided into two sections: Productive (you gonna learn something) and Pleasure (you gonna experience something). Some may span the gap, but I will only include them in the list that best fits how I see the book. This list is highly curated and is presented in alphabetical order. Instead of providing links to elsewhere on the internet, I encourage you to search for these books online yourself or at your local bookstore.
