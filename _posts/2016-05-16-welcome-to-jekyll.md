Today I finally downloaded Jekyll, and was inundated with the Jekyll theme that came with it.
After a bit of tweaking, I do feel more at home on my home page, but there is much to do still.
I should not feel like a visiter on my own site. I want to know exactly where each color came from
and exactly why everything is aligned the way it is.
