On every course syllabus there is a paragraph titled _Academic Integrity_. I've always found it weird.

## Hypocritical?

I have had to read a lot of course syllabi over the last decade of my life as a student. As a high school student, the syllabus didn't seem that important. Some were written very explicitly, defining what we would be learning each week, and other were incredibly vague, simply giving us the general topics that we would learn at some undisclosed time throughout the year. However, every single syllabus would include a paragraph on Academic Integrity without fail. At it's core it would say something about an academic offense, the typical consequence of plagiarism. When you take a step back, and looked at all the course syllabi together, it becomes pretty apparently that each warning against plagiarism looked incredibly similar.

In fact, many of the _Academic Integrity_ paragraphs that I have found on syllabi are word for word identical. It's almost as if they were copied verbatim from another source. Perhaps a previous syllabus, perhaps from the school's guidebook on what needs to be included in a syllabus. Whatever it is, I think it's hilarious that the very warning that is given to students is in itself copied.

## Why does it exist?

School is a very puzzling thing.
