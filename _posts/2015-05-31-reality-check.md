I have come to terms with the fact that I will not be able to write a blog post each and every day. I will continue to try, but I know that every now and then, due to a heavy work load, I will miss a day. That same philosophy applies to my workout schedule. Since I promised my mother I would help her with Books on Bloor, I was unable to complete my Saturday work out. Add that to the fact that it was raining this morning and I was still exhausted from Saturday: I haven’t worked out yet this weekend.

The term Renaissance Man has cropped up recently and I quite like it. The formal definition is kind of stuffy so I prefer describing it as “An individual who has a wide body of knowledge of specific things”. This seems counterintuitive as ‘wide’ and ‘specific’ rarely appear in the same thought. However it makes perfect sense to me and hopefully to you too. Having an extensive knowledge base is an appealing thing to me, and some people view me as a Renaissance Man. The more I learn the more I realize how little I know, which is why I don’t like calling myself a Renaissance Man. I do enjoy having other people identify me as a Renaissance Man, as my ego needs a boost every now and then.

My final reality check of this train of thought is very intimidating. After having a conversation about my coming years with my mother I have realized how many goals I have created for myself. None of them as impossible as Prime Minister of Canada, most of them very attainable. However while I was discussing my future I realized how many goals I actually had set for myself. In order to keep myself from going insane, I will try to list them all here to get them out of my head, for now.

* Become a Don – 2016/2017
* Gate House President – 2015/2016
* Math Union Treasurer – 2015/2016
* PEY – Summer 2017
* Pan Am Games – Summer 2015
* Tree Planting – Summer 2016
* Varsity Volleyball Staff – 2015/??
* Obtain Internship?? – Summer 2016
* Math Major – 2015/2019
* Computer Science Major – 2015/2019
* Obtain Employable Programming Skills

Getting all that off my chest felt a bit better but I still feel like I am forgetting something. It will come to me eventually. I now want to update my resume with all the work that I’ve put in with my mother’s volunteer events.

Time is the only finite resource we possess, thank you for yours
