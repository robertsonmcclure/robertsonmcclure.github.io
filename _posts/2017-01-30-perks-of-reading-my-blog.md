At first, this blog was never meant to be read. This changed when I moved from Wordpress to my own site. The articles switched from talking about myself to writing about ideas. Hopefully ideas that others would find somewhat interesting. As I continue to write, I have to face the question, why would anyone read what I've written?

Recently a friend of mine let me know that they had stumbled across my blog. I was equal parts mortified and intrigued, they had read my article on [Waking Up At Five](http://robertsonmcclure.ca/waking-up-at-five/). As much as I'm publishing this work for anyone to see, deep down and I don't actually expect anyone to read these words. The feedback I received was that what I wrote had motivated them.

I never expected this.

I am not a motivational writer, or at least I'm not trying to be. What am I trying to be? As much as it would be _beneficial_ to my career as a software developer to write about code, I really don't (yet) feel the pull to do so. People say that you should write about what you know, so I write about myself. Add that to the fact that I don't feel like I have any ideas good enough to present to the software development community (yay imposter syndrome), and you get a blog filled with introspection.

The problem with exclusive introspection is that it becomes a diary, and unless your life is _extra_ ordinary, it's going to be a pretty dull read for anyone other than yourself. This is why you rarely see a memoire from someone who didn't do something amazing. I wonder if that actually does exist somewhere, "Memoire of the Truly Average Man". Apparently many people do attempt this, which is why articles [like this one](http://annerallen.com/how-to-write-publishable-memoir-12-dos/) exist to warn people away from writing an autobiographical diary.

That being said, it is still possible to write a terrible memoir after leading an interesting life [(as president of the United States of America)](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/22/the-best-and-worst-presidential-memoirs.html). Not leading an interesting life [hasn't stopped some people, as Buzzfeed gleefully points out](https://www.buzzfeed.com/mbvd/20-of-the-most-awkward-memoirs-ever-written?utm_term=.aakG0wMxM#.ibEBx7A5A).

### Why Read My Blog???

Aside from cheeky meta-articles, what's the point of reading the words I write? I guess I want to believe that I use quality references. When I present an idea, I usually provide context in the form of links. Things that I have found interesting on the internet that I just want to share with you.

I also keep things concise. So without further ado, that's all folks.
