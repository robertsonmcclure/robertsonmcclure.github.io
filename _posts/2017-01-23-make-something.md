Isaac Asimov is prolific.

According to Wikipedia, he has written or edited more than 500 books and an estimated 90,000 letters and postcards.

According to a calculation by Charles Chu in his article Isaac Asimov: How to Never Run Out of Ideas Again, he estimates that you would have to create a full length novel every 2 weeks for 25 years just to match Asimov's output. Chu then continues in his article to elaborate on what Asimov articulated in his autobiography It's Been A Good Life.

After reading [Chu's article](https://medium.com/personal-growth/isaac-asimov-how-to-never-run-out-of-ideas-again-b7bf8e09cc91#.k5kjayciw), it motivated me to return to this blog after a 3 month hiatus. It's not that I purposely put aside the blog, or that something major upstaged it from my life, I just thought that I didn't have anything important enough to write about. I would look back at my old posts, so meticulously written and edited, and I wanted to match that quality of content. I couldn't think of anything worth while of writing about, so I didn't.

In the 10th grade art class, there was a theory presented to me about creativity. It said that the only way to have a good idea was to have lots of ideas. The example given was hundreds of sketches from a famous artist's notebook. The majority of them were underdeveloped or just bad. At the end we were shown examples of the artists published work and it blew the class away. The only way to have a good idea, is to have lots of ideas.

One of my favorite YouTubers is Casey Neistat. I started following his channel in early 2013 when I found [this commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxfZkMm3wcg&list=PLTHOlLMWEwVy2ZNmdrwRlRlVfZ8fiR_ms&index=2) he made for Nike about Making It Count. Since that video I followed his channel religiously for years. As an avid cyclist, I fell in love with his videos about biking in NYC.

When Casey Neistat starting vlogging on March 26th 2015, he made a promise to publish a video-blog every single day, and every single day he uploaded a stunning 6-10 minute video about his day. As time went on he got more and more creative with each vlog, truly reshaping the art form that is vlogging. Casey, much like my high school art teacher, subscribes to the belief that to have a good idea, you have to have lots of ideas.

I don't like the fact that I haven't published an article in 3 months. Therefore, this changes today. Call it #MotivationMonday. Call it a late New Years Resolution. Call it anything you want. Today is the day that I start writing posts consistently. My goal is to publish one blog post every Monday, every week, for the foreseeable future.

Every marathon starts with one step. This is mine.
