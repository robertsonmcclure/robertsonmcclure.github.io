Hello!

I am currently a software developer for [The Jonah Group](https://www.jonahgroup.com/) and an [assistant coach for the Men's Volleyball Program at UofT](http://www.varsityblues.ca/roster.aspx?path=mvball) while pursuing a Math Major and Computer Science Specialist at UofT.

My days are spent [reading]({{ "/library" | absolute_url }}), [tapping on a keyboard](https://github.com/robertsonmcclure), [coaching volleyball](http://varsityblues.ca/index.aspx?path=mvball&) or just [enjoying life]({{ "/projects" | absolute_url }}).

Every now and then [I write about what's on my mind]({{ "/blog" | absolute_url }}). 

If you're interested, [here's my resume.]({% link resume.pdf %})
