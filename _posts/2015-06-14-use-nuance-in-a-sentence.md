title: "use nuance in a sentence"
date: 2015-06-14

I am very pleased to add “Webmaster” to my resume. The website thereadingline.ca is now under my control, insert evil laughter here. I know that if I read the WordPress documentation on how to use their system, I’ll have no trouble doing what needs to be done. However I also know that free information rarely sticks long in memory, so instead of reading anything on how to use the WordPress Theme I inherited, I simply started using it. Of course there were buttons I couldn’t find, and I broke the webpage every now and then, but I’m pleased with the outcome as I am now familiar with WordPress is a decently short amount of time.

While my mind is on WordPress, I decided to move my blog back to WordPress. The blog was created initially on WordPress in mid May but after I got my website robertsonmcclure.github.io live, I switched it over to be self hosted. I was never thrilled with how I displayed the text, I never thought it was readable enough. Long story short, the blog is back on WordPress!

Returning to WordPress with my blog, I found myself staring at the title section attempting to will a creative and memorable title into existence. Eventually my mind came across the idea of “Clever Title”, because who actually wants to go through the hassle of thinking up a new and original title. Unfortunately after a quick search I found a religious blog with the title “Clever Title Here” which quickly persuaded me to find a new one. I’m not sure why or how but the word “Nuance” came to mind.

My first reaction was to pair “nuance” with another word, like “nuanced language” or “petty nuance”. However I quickly realized I was awful at using nuance in a sentence. Through the fire and flames of experimentation I grew to like the word, so I kept it as the stand alone title of this blog. The caption “a retrospective introspection” quickly followed as it seemed to be the best description of this entity.

Time is the only finite resource we possess, thank you for yours
