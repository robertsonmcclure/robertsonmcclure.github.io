I am not an insightful writer. I do not expect you to finish reading a piece that I have written and suddenly see things in a new light. I don’t think I’m a particularly good writer. My biggest problem with writing is that I find myself without things to write about. My lack of practice leads to a lack of quality which loops around to the conclusion that I am a poor writer. Yet here we are. I expect to look back at the first post and cringe. Yet here we are. Undertaking things that are difficult is the only way to grow as a person. This will be a welcome addition to my life, a bit more so than my new 5:30am alarm.

In the process of becoming an adult, I believe change is necessary. I want to accomplish this by building better habits. In the past I have acquired less than desirable habits, but I’ve also managed to rid myself of them over time. I want to set achievable goals for myself, and reach these goals through my new habits. I once heard that the best way not to give up on something new is to let other people know you are doing it, so that the fear of shame drives you not to quit. I don’t necessarily have a problem with motivation, I have a problem with motivating myself over things I do not enjoy. To conclude my rambling thoughts: the following are my habits/resolutions that I will try my best to follow.

1. Work out from 7am – 9am every morning except for Sunday
2. Eat breakfast every day
3. Listen to audiobooks while biking
4. Write one blog post each day
5. Practice piano once a day
6. Check email once a day at 9am
7. Only consume alcohol on Saturday evenings, not to excess
8. Use my phone less by keeping it on silent and not checking it constantly
9. Learn something new every day
10. Is all of this possible? I am not sure. It officially starts today, Friday May 22nd 2015. Why am I starting it on a Friday? Why on the 22nd? Why not New Years? Because I want to do this now.

My work out habits began earlier this week, this blog is starting today, my piano habits have been decent since I’ve been home and I haven’t drank alcohol since I had lunch with my dad earlier this month. I seem to be doing alright so far, but we shall see what the future holds.

I intend to use this blog to keep track of my personal thoughts and to slightly monitor these commitments. My mind has been on personal improvement recently and this formalized list is a direct result of that contemplation. Since I don’t want to spend too much time on this little project, I’ll attempt to keep each entry around 500 words.

Time is the only finite resource we possess, thank you for yours
