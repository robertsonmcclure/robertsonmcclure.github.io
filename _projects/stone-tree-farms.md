I was asked to propose a redesign to Stonetree Farm's [current website](http://stonetreefarms.ca).
Using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and a delightful template called [Feeling Responsive](https://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/) by [Phlow](https://github.com/Phlow), I came up with my current solution.
