School is pretty weird if you ask me. Education is lauded as the purpose of a school, but what education is actually being providing to it's students?

I found the definition of `ed·u·ca·tion` on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education):

> Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits.

Okay. That's a start.
