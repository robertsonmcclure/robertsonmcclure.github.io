From a young age I was told what I was good at and what I was not. I was told what I should be doing and what I shouldn’t be doing. I’m not even thinking about direct commands, but off hand comments that make us who we are. Think of all the times that a teacher praised your work, it’s pretty hard to do. However I can remember the exact set of circumstances around the time when I impressed a role model. This leads me to my question of what is Talent?’

“Oh you’re so good at that”, “You’ve really got some talent there” and “I wish I was as talented as you” are phrases that I’ve heard throughout my entire life. Everyone has, everyone is good at something. Notice I steered clear of using the word talent. After I reflexively accept the compliment, I usually stop and reflect on the talent that I was complimented on. Personally it falls into a short list of two categories: Volleyball and Math. These are the two skills I posses that are easy to measure from an outside source and are not common. However when I think about any skill I may display in these areas, it doesn’t come from a knack or an inate ability to be above average… it comes from hard work. A lot of hard work. Everyone knows that to be good at something, requires hard work to be put in. However few people want to put hard work into areas that they do not enjoy. This is what is commonly called “Not being a ___ person”. I hear it all the time. “Oh I’m not a math person, I just never got it” or “I’m not coordinated enough to play sports” are excuses people give to explain why they don’t have fundamental skills in certain areas.

This attitude creates a culture of “talent”. Where skills that are considered hard to achieve are not pursued as it requires “talent” to achieve them. I believe this is false. It may be true that not everyone starts on the same baseline, some people can simply jump higher than others off the bat etc. But the notion of “talent” is a misguided idea that lends people an easy excuse to not be good at something, or to not even attempt it in the first place.

My thoughts and ideas on this matter are confusing to myself, so I don’t expect my written prose to be anything but confusing. This is my first attempt at putting to words my opinions on the notion of “talent” and trying to deal with the phrase “I am not a math person”. I have encountered that phrase so often it has stuck with me. I hope to expand on my written thoughts on this topic in later blog posts.
