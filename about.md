## I am Robertson. Literally.

My dad's name is Robert, which makes me Robert's son. Some might say that my first name is a Dad Joke.

I started UofT studying Pure Math. On a whim I took a Computer Science course and never looked back.

Most of my time is spent tapping on a keyboard or coaching volleyball, sometimes both! I am the assistant coach for UofT Men's Volleyball Program and it's awesome. Amongst other things, I get to do statistical analysis on volleyball, which is a sporty nerd's dream come true.
