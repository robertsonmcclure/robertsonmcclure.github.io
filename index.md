Hello!

I love [creating things]({{ "/projects" | absolute_url }}), [reading]({{ "/library" | absolute_url }}), [writing]({{ "/blog" | absolute_url }}) and being in the moment.

I study Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Toronto.

I am a [coach](http://www.varsityblues.ca/roster.aspx?path=mvball) with the Men's Volleyball Program at UofT.

I work for [The Jonah Group](https://www.jonahgroup.com/).

Welcome to my small corner of the internet.
